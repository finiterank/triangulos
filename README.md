triangulos
==========

Geometric construction: From a point P, drop perpendiculars to the sides of a surrounding triangle. This defines three points; connect those to make a new triangle and drop perpendiculars to its sides. Repeat three times this procedure, obtaining each time a smaller triangle. The third new triangle will be similar to the original one.
